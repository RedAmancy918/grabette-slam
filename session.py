"""Per-session run state — one RunSession per browser session, never shared.

Several people use the Space at the same time, each in their own Gradio session.
Nothing about a run may leak from one session into another: not the cooperative
control flags (pause / cancel), and above all not the flagged episodes published
by the check / sync / trajectory review gates — those name someone else's dataset.

So every flag that used to be a module-level global lives here, on a RunSession
looked up by the caller's `gr.Request.session_hash`. Handlers annotate a
`request: gr.Request` parameter (Gradio injects it — it is NOT a UI input) and
call `session.get(request)`; the worker thread captures the object itself, so a
run keeps working on its own flags even after its page is gone.
